# Adrift

The theme of OSU Game Creation Club's Autumn 2024 game jam was Space! The original concept behind the project was travelling as a solo space salvager/miner, in a rather unsettlingly dark area of space. 
We had a lot of ideas but experienced some struggle with scope and with github, and ultimately decided to accept the jank and commit minor copyright infringement to create some sort of objective. 
Ultimately, the main goal was to communicate the vibes because the gameplay we planned was rather open-ended, and would have taken a long time to implement properly.

All assets are ours except for the obvious one.
